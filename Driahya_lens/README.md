# DrishyaAI - Interactive Map Interface

A Next.js application featuring an intelligent map interface with natural language queries, property price analysis, and climate risk visualization.

## Features

🗺️ **Interactive Leaflet Integration** - Interactive map with multiple layer support and enhanced highlighting
🧠 **Gemini AI Natural Language Queries** - Google AI-powered query processing with intelligent fallback (e.g., "Show me wards in Pune where property values rose >30% and flood risk increased since 2015")
📊 **Multi-layer Visualization** - Property price heatmaps, climate risk overlays, and boundary data with enhanced visual feedback
⏰ **Time Warp Controls** - Interactive time range slider for temporal analysis
📱 **Smart Side Panel** - AI-generated insights, evidence-based summaries with stats, and data sources
🎯 **Intelligent Highlighting** - Automatic zoom and animated highlight of relevant areas with glow effects
✨ **Enhanced Visual Feedback** - Pulsing animations and visual indicators for search results

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Gemini AI (Optional)

For enhanced AI-powered natural language processing:

1. Get your Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
# .env.local
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

**Note:** The application will work without this API key, using a fallback natural language processor, but Gemini AI provides more accurate query understanding and better insights.

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Usage

### Natural Language Queries

The application supports intelligent natural language queries. Here are some examples:

- `"Show me wards in Pune where property values rose >30% and flood risk increased since 2015"`
- `"Find areas in Pune with property appreciation over 25% since 2020"`
- `"Display Kothrud area analysis"`
- `"Show me Aundh ward with high flood risk"`

### Map Controls

- **Layer Toggle** (top-left): Enable/disable property heatmap, climate risk overlay, and boundaries
- **Time Slider** (bottom): Adjust the time range for analysis (2010-2024)
- **Side Panel**: View detailed results, insights, and data sources

### Map Layers

1. **Property Heatmap** - Color-coded visualization of property price changes
2. **Climate Risk Overlay** - Flood and climate risk indicators
3. **Boundaries** - Administrative and neighborhood boundaries

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Maps**: Leaflet, React Leaflet
- **AI**: Google Gemini AI for natural language processing
